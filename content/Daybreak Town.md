![[Daybreak Town Overview.jpg]]

Hidden within the Astral Sea, there exists a town governed by five cooperating factions, each led by a [[Foreteller]] entrusted with a unique role to secure the [[Grand Prosperity]] outlined in the [[Book of Prophecies]].
## **Geography and Structure**
The town is situated in a seemingly infinite hilly green meadow that stretches far beyond the horizon, with water coming in from a river that flows down a large hill overlooking the settlement. The architecture and placement of the buildings is mostly tall and compact, with slanted roofs to prepare for the snow in the winter season. Long stairways and narrow roads paved with granite bricks that readily take on the glow of the sky wind througout the tightly-built streets, making it easy to get lost if you don't know the way. 

The most striking structural landmark by far is the [[Clocktower]], an enormous, grand, twin-towered building that overlooks everything from its perch in the center of Daybreak Town. It is here where the [[Foreteller|Foretellers]] are said to convene and seek counsel with the enigmatic [[Master of Masters]].
## **Society**
### The Book of Prophecies and the Unions
An extremely well-protected treasure and governing force of Daybreak Town is the Book of Prophecies. A tome said to dictate the events that will transpire to shape the destiny of the town's fight against Darkness and possibly the fate of the world itself. Each Foreteller possseses their own copy and it is their role to impart its knowledge to the populace in order to strive towards an event described as the [[Grand Prosperity]]. Although a vast majority agree that the Grand Prosperity is the ultimately good outcome of the fate the book presents, the details of what that prosperity entails are a debated topic, which led to the formation of the five Unions.

These five competing factions make up the heart of Daybreak Town's society. Though they cooperate to ensure the town's overall well-being, each works towards achieving their own ideal vision of the [[Grand Prosperity]], and so they uphold differing values, sometimes even conflicting with those of the other Unions. At the head of each Union is their [[Foreteller]], a [[Keyblade]] Master who champions the same values as their Union. Each citizen is required to register as a member of a Union. Those that do not are treated as outsiders and are generally shunned by the rest of the townspeople.

The five Unions are:
- [[Anguis]], led by [[Foreteller Invi]] champions knowledge and discovery
- [[Leopardos]], led by [[Foreteller Gula]] champions nature and community 
- [[Unicornis]], led by [[Foreteller Ira]] champions determination and courage  
- [[Ursus]], led by [[Foreteller Aced]] champions fortitude and order 
- [[Vulpes]], led by [[Foreteller Ava]] champions freedom and flexibility
### The Fight Against Darkness
Though some of their goals may differ, each Union is entrusted with a common duty, to combat the forces of darkness that would encroach upon and disrupt the balance of the world. The main method of choice for accomplishing this feat is the vanquishing of [[Heartless]], malicious beings born from negative emotions that coalesce and soldiify into coorporeal form within the Shadowfell. Defeated Heartless leave behind a shining, crystaline substance called [[Lux]] that is gathered as a resource to be used by the town. The amount of Lux a Union collectively gathers also plays an important part in determining their social standing. Every three months, a [[Ranking Ceremony]] is held to crown the Unions that have collected the most Lux during the Ranking Period. Unions that achieve a high Ranking receive special benefits such as access to high-end facilities and increased political influence for the duration of the following Ranking Period.
### The Keyblade
Though anyone with enough combat prowess can participate in the battle against Darkness, few do so bearing the title "Keybearer". The [[Keyblade]] is a powerful weapon forged with a secret art known only to the [[Foreteller|Foretellers]] and their [[Master of Masters|Master]]. It is a versatile implement that reflects the heart of its wielder, awakening supernatural abilities unqiue to them. It's other capabilities include the power to lock and unlock passageways and seals of all sorts, physical or metaphysical; a beacon that alerts the wielder to the presence of Darkness, and the ability to extract Lux from [[Heartless]] in its pure, untainted form when they are slain in the Keyblade's vicinity. Many citizens who take up arms against the Darkness aspire to become Keybearers, and thus enroll in rigourous training and study. Most who seek this path never graduate from the generic replica Keyblades they are initially bestowed, making it clear that those who wield a true Keyblade are a cut above the rest.
